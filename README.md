# Fixed-Point Arithmetic Performance Enhancement
# Overview
This project demonstrates how to use fixed-point arithmetic to improve performance on systems without 
a Floating Point Unit (FPU), such as certain microcontrollers (MCUs). The provided code includes fixed-point 
multiplication and division examples and compares their performance to traditional floating-point operations.

# File Contents
Using Fixed-Point Arithmetic to Improve Performance on Systems Without an FPU.c: Contains the implementation 
of fixed-point arithmetic operations and performance comparison tests.

# Key Concepts
# Fixed-Point Arithmetic
Fixed-point arithmetic represents real numbers as integers with a fixed number of bits for the integer and 
fractional parts. This method allows efficient arithmetic operations on systems that lack an FPU, providing 
better performance and deterministic execution times.

# Code Implementation
The code includes:

Macros and Definitions: For converting between floating-point and fixed-point representations.

Fixed-Point Multiplication and Division Functions: Implementations using 64-bit intermediate results to ensure accuracy.

Performance Comparison Tests: Functions to compare the execution time of fixed-point and floating-point operations.

# Usage
To run the code, compile and execute the Using Fixed-Point Arithmetic to Improve Performance on Systems Without an FPU.c 
file using your preferred C compiler. The program will output the results of fixed-point and floating-point multiplications and their execution times.

# Compilation
gcc -o fixed_point_performance Using Fixed-Point Arithmetic to Improve Performance on Systems Without an FPU.c

# Execution
./fixed_point_performance

# Output
The program will print the results of the fixed-point and floating-point multiplications and their respective 
execution times, allowing you to compare their performance directly.

# Conclusion
Using fixed-point arithmetic can significantly enhance performance in embedded systems that lack an FPU. 
This project provides a practical implementation and demonstrates the benefits of fixed-point operations over 
floating-point operations in such environments.
